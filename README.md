# AdrienneLewis-sql_alchemy_climate
This project displays use of SQL alchemy to connect to a SQLite database. The data was manipulated and cleaned using Pandas to display Climate data. This data and the visualizations built would be useful to plan a vacation to Hawaii and find the best time of year to have nice weather during the stay.
